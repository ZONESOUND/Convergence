  "In being able to exist in this world yet reaching another, there lies a profound joy. This musical piece encapsulates the journey of the FORMOSAT satellites."<br><br>

  The Taiwan Space Agency commissioned Professor Ching-Wen Chao of Taiwan Normal University to create an orchestral piece called <b>Messages</b> to pay homage to the entire FORMOSAT Satellite family and bid FORMOSAT-7 a safe journey as it departs for the United States in 2020. As part of this musical journey, Director Shen Keh-Shang was tasked with creating a short film called <b>Kids on the Orbit - Dedicated to the FORMOSAT Satellites</b> to document the process.<br><br>

  This film belongs to the Taiwan Space Agency.

  The Taiwan Space Agency was founded in 1991 and was restructured in January 2023 as a statutory corporation under the National Science and Technology Council. It is responsible for all space-related affairs in Taiwan, with its duties outlined in the "Space Development Law." These duties include developing space technology, promoting the space industry, cultivating space technology talent, and promoting space science education. Over the past 30 years, the agency has successfully managed satellite projects such as FORMOSAT-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and TRITON. Currently, Taiwan has eight satellites orbiting in space: Formosat-5 (1 satellite), Formosat-7 (6 satellites), and TRITON (1 satellite). In the future, the Taiwan Space Agency plans to launch various projects such as the Formosat-8 Optical Remote Sensing Satellite constellation, the Formosat-9 Synthetic Aperture Radar Satellite constellation, the B5G Low-Orbit Communication Experimental Satellite project, the Orbital Rocket project, and the National Launch Site Construction Project, all aimed at accelerating the development of Taiwan's space industry.
