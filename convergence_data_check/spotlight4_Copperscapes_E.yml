  Copper is a mineral that lives with(in) us and on which our households, cities, digital desires, and selves depend. And while our bodies rely on copper to function properly, the rapacious extraction of copper disproportionately labored by women and children in the global South takes a deleterious toll on their health. Specifically, overexposure to copper often results in Wilson’s disease — liver failure, cognitive and neurological complications — and whose tell-tale sign is copper-colored eyes. Jahn positions the copper-colored eyes as witnesses to the “body burdens” absorbed by mining communities and the loss of bodily sovereignty to meet the needs of Others’ mineralogical dependencies in these digital prints. The video showcases Jahn embodying Aphrodite, exploring the complex mineral economics, and highlighting the impact of mining on bodily and terrestrial sovereignty through a dramatic reading of the Mining Law of 1872.
