  <i>Leche Holográfica</i> (Holographic Milk) is a meditative <i>rogativa</i> to resonate and harmonize with different elements, so we can imagine the future as places that exist between spiral times. A non-extractivist communion among kingdoms that originates from the sweetness of the Leche Holográfica and the <i>Gran Madre</i>’s nurturing songs. We received her <i>chorro</i> of information and vibrational sonic wisdom from her as we navigate these troubled times.<br><br>

  Leche Holográfica nurtures the <i>porvenir</i> with the information of the future. We drink it, we swim in it, we live in it and we access our cosmic past through it. We have forgotten this, but we carry all the information we need to move forward within us. We now have to learn how to activate it. Spirituality and the quantum realm don’t know about distances. As an effort to remember, we invite you to dive with us into a shapeshifting quantum trip of connection from the quartzs and silicon that conform our bones, the center of the Earth, the chips of our electronic devices, in order to call for what is common to us. We become many as we listen and travel through different registers and learn through multiple temporalities of planetary fractals in alliance with the digital kingdom.

  This work is a collaboration between Nicole L’Huillier and Patricia Domínguez and was commissioned by the Inter-American Development Bank.
