  <i>Nodal Narratives of the Deep Sea</i> charts the source and pathways of our internet, the ecosystem within which it operates, and the life forms that live around it. It focuses specifically on submarine cables as hidden critical infrastructure that carries the world’s data, materiality, connection – the project of modernity, the premise of capitalist expansion, and abstraction – as lines running through the earth almost existing in a separate temporality. While the word cable accurately describes the conduit itself, mining colonies, satellite connections, myths, and wars are contained within it. How does data travel? Who and what does it meet on the way? Where are these conduits? A map attempts to reconsider the dominant layers within this ecosystem, annotated by a series of drawings, objects and videos telling stories of unstable relationships and those yet to be discovered. Here, humans, plants, and animals interact with and help redefine what it means to live with critical infrastructure.
