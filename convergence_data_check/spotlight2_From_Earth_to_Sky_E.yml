  Journeying through the depths of ancient lava flows, volcanic structures, and meandering valleys, one feels the resonance of distant celestial bodies. Against the dramatic backdrop of the Canary Islands’ volcanic landscape and the Arctic desert of Svalbard, where windstorms sculpt the terrain, art and science intersect. Analog sites on Earth, resembling extraterrestrial landscapes, unveil the unexpected richness of life thriving in seemingly barren environments.<>br><br>

  What defines a desert, once thought devoid of life, now teems with vitality, challenging preconceptions and expanding horizons. *From Earth to Sky* offers a sensory exploration where seven sensing devices from the MIT Media Lab and MIT Space Exploration Initiative bring new possibilities into the realm of scientific inquiry and artistic expression.

  The fieldwork showcased in From Earth to Sky was undertaken through Fieldscape, an experimental and interdisciplinary program founded and directed by Maggie Coblentz. Fieldscape serves as a dynamic platform blending scientific and artistic field methodologies, pushing the boundaries of exploration.<br></br>

  In October 2022 and July 2023, efforts from the MIT Space Exploration Initiative and the MIT Media Lab led expeditions in Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. These endeavors were dedicated to testing a range of technologies, encompassing remote geological surveying, the testing of intelligent mapping algorithms, and wildlife observation in the region.<br></br>

  Fieldwork continued to evolve in February 2024 as researchers associated with the MIT Space Exploration Initiative explored the volcanic terrains of Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands. Collaboratively, their investigations served a dual purpose: evaluating technologies crucial for lunar exploration and unraveling the geological history of our planet. Recognized as a prime space analog environment, these projects facilitated mutual exploration, sparking inquiries into the use of Earth as a testbed for space research and the underlying motivations behind such endeavors.
