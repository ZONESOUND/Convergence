  "How to buy/own/mint one millilitre of the South China Sea (Nan Hai)?" --- Forkonomy() is an art and activist project to explore the idea of sovernity and ownership through such a speculative question. Despite the fact that Nan Hai is one of the world’s most heavily trafficked waterways for international trade, it is also one of the most disputable sea areas in the world over the territorial claims. From China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia ...etc, multiple Asian governments assert sovereignty over its rocks, reefs, as well as other geographic features and undersea natural resources, made the oceanic object highly tangible and material, and yet significantly economical, military and political.<br><br>

  In Forkonomy(), Taiwan artist Tzu Tung Lee and Hong Kong artist Winnie Soon set the project as a commoning ship,  inviting people of the pacific to queer and care the matters of hierarchies, ownership, gendered labour division, as well as to fight against the constant autonomical threats regarding the land and the sea. This exhibition shows the videos of the artist pirating the Nan Hai water, the Forkonomy() workshop that have discussed the ownership and priced of the sea, as well as the documents of  the workshop, including the physical contract, code of conduct, and the digital contract that has deployed on the blockchain.<br><br>
